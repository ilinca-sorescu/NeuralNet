# NeuralNet
A simple neural network implemented from scratch.

By default, it predicts the volume of a cylinder given its radius and height. To use the training data for the cylinder problem run makeData.py. It will populate cylinder.train and cylinder.validate with example cases of radius, height and volume of arbitrary cylinders.
Compile NeuralNet.cpp and run to see the results.

The main function provides an example use case. Make sure to scale the inputs and labels to be in [0,1] for optimal results.
